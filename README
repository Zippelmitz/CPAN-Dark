README for CPAN::Dark

CPAN::Dark allows you to manage your own sparse DarkPAN: a CPAN-alike which
contains only those distributions you inject.

While CPAN::Dark uses CPAN::Mini and CPAN::Mini::Inject, it does not require
you to maintain your own full mirror of the public CPAN. As a result, you
should configure your module installation and metadata tools (such as
App::cpanminus and App::cpanoutdated) to use your local DarkPAN first, then
fall back to the public CPAN.
